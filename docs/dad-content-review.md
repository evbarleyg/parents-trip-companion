## Unresolved Items

| Batch ID | Entry ID | Why unresolved | Suggested next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-02-20-dad-drop-01 | Number 3 | Time-sequence context points to Al Maha morning after Abu Dhabi, but exact day may be Feb 9 or Feb 10. Currently mapped to 2026-02-10. | Confirm whether this note should sit on 2026-02-09 or 2026-02-10. |
| 2026-02-20-dad-drop-01 | Number 5 | Duplicate text of Number 4 (same Salalah wording). Not published separately. | Confirm whether Number 5 was intended as a different update. |
| 2026-02-20-dad-drop-01 | photo-gps-all | All 29 canonical photos include EXIF creation dates but no GPS coordinates in shared files. | If exact pin-point map placement is needed, provide originals with location metadata; current mapping uses itinerary day coordinates. |
